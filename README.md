### What I learned

#### Project Challenges

This repository focuses on my journey to develop and possibly master HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In this initial project, I encountered several challenges that helped me learn and grow as a developer.

##### Header

The header posed the first set of challenges. One of them was positioning the smartphone image centrally below the header, while the side images required careful handling of positioning, z-index, and screen coordinates. To further enhance my skills, I intend to explore responsive design techniques that allow for automatic adjustment of elements as the screen size varies.

##### Footer

The footer presented similar challenges, mainly related to different positioning techniques and content overlap. Overcoming these hurdles required thoughtful consideration of layout and design choices.

##### CSS Refactoring

I made an effort to follow the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology and organize my CSS files according to the website's sections. As a beginner, I recognize the importance of continuously improving code quality. In future projects, I aim to explore alternative approaches to refactoring CSS, striving for shorter, more efficient, and optimized stylesheets.
